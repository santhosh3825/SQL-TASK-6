## ðŸ§  Hints Implemented

- `a.` Used `EXTRACT(MONTH FROM order_date)` for month extraction
- `b.` Grouped data by both year and month
- `c.` Summed `amount` to calculate monthly revenue
- `d.` Counted distinct `order_id`s for order volume
- `e.` Sorted results using `ORDER BY`
- `f.` Filtered for Janâ€“Apr 2024 using `WHERE`

## ðŸ’¡ SQL Query Used

```sql
SELECT
    EXTRACT(YEAR FROM order_date) AS year,
    EXTRACT(MONTH FROM order_date) AS month,
    SUM(amount) AS total_revenue,
    COUNT(DISTINCT order_id) AS order_volume
FROM
    orders
WHERE
    order_date BETWEEN '2024-01-01' AND '2024-04-30'
GROUP BY
    year, month
ORDER BY
    year, month;
